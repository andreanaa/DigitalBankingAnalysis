## 95% Confidence Interval Analysis for Difference in Proportions

1. **Jenius vs. Blu users:** The analysis shows that the difference in proportions between Jenius and Blu users ranges from 2.9% to 9.25%. This implies that, within the Indonesian digital banking population, Jenius is consistently more popular by at least 2.9% and at most 9.25% compared to Blu. This may be due to Jenius' stronger marketing presence compared to Blu by BCA, which is more widely recognized for traditional banking services than its digital product, Blu.
   
2. **Transfer feature users vs. bill payment users:** The difference in proportion between transfer feature users and bill payment feature users ranges from 37% to 48%. This indicates that transfer is significantly more widely used compared to bill payments. This may be due to the variety of bill payment methods available, low familiarity with digital banking bill payment systems, and the alternative of paying bills directly at service offices. Meanwhile, digital transfers are considered more efficient than visiting physical banks and are widely accepted by the public.
