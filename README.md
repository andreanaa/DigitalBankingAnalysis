## Data and Data Structure

The dataset analyzed contains information related to digital banking. The data was obtained from a conducted survey involving 2,095 respondents. The dataset includes data on gender, age, education, income, increase in online activity, whether respondents own a digital bank account, their choice of digital bank, reasons for using the digital bank, features used, and complaints while using digital banking services.

## Demographics

1. The respondents' gender distribution consists of 50% male, 49% female, and 1% who did not answer. The gender proportion is nearly balanced.
2. The largest age group is 15–20 years old, making up 71% of respondents, followed by 21–30 years old (14%), 41–50 years old (7%), and others with smaller proportions. Most respondents are teenagers.
3. Regarding education level, 70% of respondents graduated from high school, 24% hold a bachelor's degree, 3% a master's degree, and others in smaller proportions. Many respondents are likely in college, as indicated by high school being their latest completed education.
4. Most respondents earn less than IDR 2 million per month (71%), followed by 13% earning IDR 2–5 million, 7% earning IDR 5–10 million, and others earning higher in smaller proportions.

## Proportion Analysis

1. Over the past 3 months, online activity has increased, particularly on social media (72%), video/movie streaming (69%), and attending online classes (68%). This aligns with the respondent profile, where 71% are recent high school graduates currently in college.
2. Among all respondents, only 25% have a digital bank account.
3. The most used digital bank among the 2,095 respondents is Jenius (10%), followed by Digibank (1%), and other digital banks with smaller proportions.
4. Among the 519 respondents with digital bank accounts, the top reasons for using digital banks include ease of transactions (56%), trend (13.7%), ease of account opening (45%), diverse features (25%), promotions (27%), and other reasons.
5. The five most frequently used features in digital banking are balance checking (51%), transfers (70%), purchases (47%), bill payments (28%), and transaction history (25%).
6. Complaints experienced by digital banking users include failed transactions with balance deductions (7%), balance deductions without transactions (5%), and difficulty contacting customer service (13.5%).

## 95% Confidence Interval Analysis for Difference in Proportions

1. **Jenius vs. Blu users:** The analysis shows that the difference in proportions between Jenius and Blu users ranges from 2.9% to 9.25%. This implies that, within the Indonesian digital banking population, Jenius is consistently more popular by at least 2.9% and at most 9.25% compared to Blu. This may be due to Jenius' stronger marketing presence compared to Blu by BCA, which is more widely recognized for traditional banking services than its digital product, Blu.
   
2. **Transfer feature users vs. bill payment users:** The difference in proportion between transfer feature users and bill payment feature users ranges from 37% to 48%. This indicates that transfer is significantly more widely used compared to bill payments. This may be due to the variety of bill payment methods available, low familiarity with digital banking bill payment systems, and the alternative of paying bills directly at service offices. Meanwhile, digital transfers are considered more efficient than visiting physical banks and are widely accepted by the public.
